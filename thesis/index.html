		<p><b>Field effect transistors</b> are a switch device, in which current flows from a grounded Source terminal to a biased Drain terminal, due to voltage applied at Gate terminal; when the Gate voltage is removed, current stops flowing between Source and Drain. When such a device is made with organic semiconductors (OSC), which are molecular hydrocarbons or polymers, it is known as Organic Field Effect Transistors (OFETs). The charge carrier density of OSC is low, and hence the carriers are drawn from Source and Drain by Gate voltage to accumulate at the dielectric interface. The accumulated  charge carrier sheet forms a conducting channel that enables current flow from grounded Source to biased Drain. </p>

   <center><img src="sitefigsfet.jpg" width="600" height="200" align="middle"></img></center>

<br>
<p> The OFET performance can thus be enhanced by increasing the charge carrier mobility of the OSC, which allows the charge carriers move at a higher velocity under electric field. Also, increasing the charge carrier density of the OSC would increase current by allowing more charge carriers to contribute to the current. Further, as charge injection from Source to OSC is essential for the current flow, any resistance at the interface of Source and OSC would serve to limit the device current. This is equivalent to an interface resistance being in series with resistance of channel, and hence value of this contact resistance must be significantly lower than that of channel. </p>



<p> The thesis shows three ways to improve the performance of OFETs. </p>
                  <ul >
                  <li><b>Molecular Structure: </b>Two highly similar polymer semiconductors with an order of magnitude difference in charge carrier mobility presents an intriguing problem. Study of OFET characteristic combined with first principle calculations enables us to demonstrate that inclusion of rigid substituent group as the side chain pendant group significantly enhances the charge carrier mobility.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Self Assembled Monolayer at Electrodes: </b> A remarkable increase in Threshold voltage and mobility, and decrease in contact resistance is brought about by functionalizing OFET electrodes with self assembled monolayer (SAM). However, the trends in device characteristics contradict the trends in work function, forcing us to rethink the mechanism of SAM. A combination of first principle calculations on the interface stack, and mathematical modeling of the interface energetics reveals the nature of energy level alignment at the interface and how the doping action of SAM increases charge carrier density in OSC. </li>
<br>

		  <li><b>Charge Transport in OFETs: </b> A measurement of temperature dependent characteristics of the OFETs of different polymer OSC is carried out. The Arrhenius relationship between mobility and temperature is characterized by the activation energy and prefactor. Monte Carlo simulatios replicating the charge carrier path in OFET are carried out, varying the molecular as well as thinfilm properties in simulated grid. The simulation parameters leading to best match with temperature based characteristics exhibit the interplay between various factors governing charge transport and their relative effects. This enables us to point to charge transfer integral as the key parameter responsible for the evolution of charge transport properties of recent functional polymers. </li>

    <p> The interface of Source/Drain contacts with semiconductor has a resistance in series with the OFET channel. Being in series with the channel, if its resistance becomes higher than channel resistance, the device current will be low, no matter how efficient the channel is. One way to reduce resistance at interface is to insert a<b> self assembled monolayer (SAM) </b>of a polar material, which can reduce the energy barrier. But the exact mechanism of SAM is not established. We explored the action of SAM at electrodes by studying OFETs of pentacene having Cu electrodes functionalized by SAM of PFBT or PFDT molecules. The results enabled us to develop mathematical models to predict interface properties of SAM at electrodes, as well as device characteristics of SAM functionionalized OFETs. <a href= "https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.202101377"> Paper </a> </p>

		<h4 style="color:purple;"> Material & Device Characteristics <b></b></h4>
<p> Layer of SAM on Copper increases its work function from -4.82 eV to -5.32 eV for PFBT and -5.54 eV for PFDT. Either is higher than the HOMO level of pentacene, and hole injection would be expected to improve. But the device characteristics tell another story. The current in PFBT devices is higher, its threshold voltage shifted to more positive values, and its contact resistance is lower than devices with PFDT. We seek to understand this contradiction in work function trends and device behaviour.</p>

		<center><img src="SAMdev.jpg" width="600" height="240" align="middle" Vspace="30"></img></center>
	      


              <h4 style="color:purple;">Interface Orbitals </h4>
	    
		<p>First principle calculations with the interface molecular configuration revealed a key difference between either SAM molecule at the interface. Calculations using density functional theory showed the HOMO of the Pentacene/SAM/Cu system for PFBT and PFDT. HOMO is located over the pentacene molecule in either case, but with PFBT it extends further to Cu electrodes. The delocalization of orbitals enables a faster charge transfer across this interface. </p>


              <h4 style="color:purple;"> Mechanism of SAM at Electrodes </h4>


              <p> Combining device observations with ab-initio calculations allows us insight into the working of SAM at electrodes in OFETs. During interface formation itself, the energy levels of SAM/Cu tend to align at midgap of pentacene. This is achieved by electrons transferring from pentacene to SAM/Cu, leaving behind hole carrying pentacene cations, accompanied by bending of energy levels within pentacene. These excess holes increased conductivity of pentacene, allowing mobility to be higher and threshold voltage larger. The final alignment of energy levels is not at midgap, but rather the SAM/Cu level is pinned above the pentacene HOMO, with a mismatch which is the energy barrier.  </p>

<p>Solving the Possion’s equation at the interface allowed us to calculate the charge carrier density and energy level bending within pentacene. The energy barrier at interface of pentacene and PFDT/Cu is higher than at PFBT/Cu, leading to the difference in contact resistance. The charge carrier density in pentacene in OFETs with PFBT/Cu is greater than with PFDT/Cu, explaining the difference in mobility and threshold voltage. </p>

<h4 style="color:purple;"> Device Model </h4>

<p>The interface properties allows us to replicate the observed OFET characteristics. Knowing the excess charge carrier density in channel, we add the contribution to linear current by the excess charge carriers to that of accumulated charge carriers. As the device enters saturation regime, the pinch-off is delayed by the excess charge carriers which reduces Drain voltage to an effective channel voltage V<sub>C</sub>, and a gradual transition to Drain voltage independent Drain current occurs. The equations of OFET Drain current are modified for the conditions in SAM modified OFETs, and characteristics obtained.
</p>  
	    $$ I_{D\mathrm{(Linear)}} = \left( qtn + C_i(V_G-V_T -V_D/2) \right) \mu V_D \frac{W}{L} $$
	    $$ I_{D\mathrm{(Presaturation)}} = \left( qtn + C_i(V_G-V_T -V_C/2) \right) \mu V_C \frac{W}{L} $$
	    $$ I_{D\mathrm{(Saturation)}} = \frac{\mu W}{2L} (V_G-V_T)^2 $$

<br>

<p> We have been able to establish that the alteration in energy level alignment and charge carrier doping of SAM/Cu influences the device characteristics. </p>

              	<p>Varying the molecular structure or thinfilm morphology of polymers affect the charge transport in the films. But when two highly similar polymers are found to have highly different electronic properties, an investigation is called for. PTB7 and PTB7-Th are identical polymers, except the pendant group connecting side chains to main chain in PTB7 is an oxygen atom, while it is thiophene group in PTB7-Th. We found that their OFETs have order of magnitude difference in charge carrier mobility. Calculations on the respective polymer molecules reveal a vast difference in reorganisation energy brought about by changing the pendant group. This brings about a paradigm shift in the role of side chain substituent groups in affecting charge transport in polymers. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805878">Paper</a> </p>

                <h4 style="color:purple;">OFET Characteristics</h4>
<p>We fabricated OFETs with PTB7-Th and PTB7 as OSC. A bilayer dielectric was used to enhance the performance of OFETs. With this configuration, the Drain current of PTB7 devices was found to be an order of magnitude higher than previously reported. Further, this was the first report of OFETs with PTB7-Th. The FET mobility of PTB7-Th was found to be an order of magnitude higher than PTB7, which is unexpected for polymers identical in all aspects except side chain pendant group.</p>

<h4 style="color:purple;">Charge Transfer in Molecules</h4>
                <p> To understand how subtle changes in molecular structure can bring about substantial changes in charge transport in the polymer, we look at the process of charge transfer between molecules. Charge transport in a polymer OSC occurs by thermally assisted hopping. The charge carrier gets localised on one polymer segment, and hops to a neighbouring segment where energetics are feasible. When a neutral segment acquires a charge carrier from its neighbour, it undergoes changes in bond lengths and bond angles, as the additional charge disrupts the neutral configuration. The physical process of rearrangement consumes energy, known as Reorganization Energy (RE). Charge transfer occurs when the requirement of RE can be fulfilled. In other words, RE acts as an activation barrier to process of charge transfer. Further, charge transfer takes place only when the orbitals of the participating polymer segments overlap in space. The extent of overlap is represented by the parameter Charge Transfer Integral (J), which increases when the orbital area is high, and the orientation of molecules is more regular. This relationship between charge transport and the parameters reorganization energy and charge transfer integral are given by the Marcus equation, for rate of charge transfer (k) between identical molecules:</p>

$$ k= \frac{J^2}{h} \sqrt {\frac{\pi}{\pi \lambda kT}} \exp\left({\frac{-\lambda}{4kT}}\right) $$

<p>Thus, charge transport is faster, and hence carrier mobility higher, with a lower RE, and a higher J.</p>

<h4 style="color:purple;">Molecular Properties</h4>
<p> To examine the effect of molecular properties and their effect on charge transport, we performed first principle calculations on the molecular structures as well as cations of PTB7 and PTB7-Th. Calculations were done by density functional theory (DFT) using package Gaussian09. Based on the difference of energy between ground state and cationic configuration for neutral or charged molecule, reorganisation energy was calculated for either monomer. 
		From schematic shown below, reorganisation energy is calculated as:</p> 
		$$ \lambda = E_0^0- E_0^+ +E_+^+ -E_+^0 $$

              <center><img src="thRE.png" width="360" height="420" align="middle" Vspace="30"></img></center>
<p>The RE of PTB7 is 340 meV, which is more than twice of the RE of PTB7-Th, 150 meV. Further, we assume that J is similar for both polymers, as their molecular structures are nearly identical, and it has been shown that the thinfilms of respective polymers also have highly similar morphology. With this assumption, based on the values of RE, Marcus equation shows that k is ten times higher for PTB7-Th than for PTB7. 
</p>

<h4 style="color:purple;"> Mobility Enhancement via Rigid Substituent Group</h4>

<p>We found that PTB7-Th had an order of magnitude higher mobility as compared to PTB7 despite having nearly identical molecular structures and highly similar thinfilm morphology. The explanation for this was found by DFT calculations. The addition of the bulky thiophene group as the pendant group imparts rigidity to PTB7-Th and decreases the extent of rearrangement when charged. This reduces the RE of PTB7-Th to less than half of PTB7, and hence increases the mobility by an order of magnitude. We find that addition of a suitable substituent to reduce RE, which does not impact J, can raise the mobility of polymer significantly. </p>
