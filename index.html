<h1>Research Page</h1>
<p>My research involves working with molecular hydrocarbon and polymer semiconductors for electronic and optoelectronic devices. For device operation, charges trasnport across thinfilms of these organic materials. My work is on understanding the charge transport process, to obtain keys to improve device performance. </p>

<h3>Influence of Molecular and Thinfilm Parameters on Charge Transport </h3>
<p> Amorphous polymers with different molecular structures show differences in charge transport, but what parameters are actually making the difference? And while polymers are amorphous thinfilms, the disorder varies to affect charge transport further. We start with two polymers with different types of molecules; P3HT a homopolymer, and PTB7 a DA copolymer. We fabricated and studied device characteristics of transistors with these semiconducting polymers at different temperatures. We then carried out numerical simulations of charge transport in network of disordered sites. The values of molecular and film paramteres used in simulations gave us insight into differences in charge transport in these different polymers. </p>

<h3>Charge Carrier Doping as Mechanism of Self Assembled Monolayers in OFETs</h3>
<p> SAM are known to improve device characteristics and reduce contact resistance in transistors. But the mechanism is still unclear. We sought to decrease contact resistance of Cu electrodes in pentacene transistors, by applying SAM of two common fluorinated molecules, PFBT and PFDT, on Cu thinfilms. The differences in effect of either SAM were revealed molecular simulations. We found that the device characteristics can be explained if charge transferred by SAM-electrode during interface formation is considered. We developed a model based on this mechanism to predict interface properties and device characteristics. </p>

<h3> Influence of Reorganization Energy on Charge Carrier Mobility </h3>
<p> Instead of polymers with highly different molecular structures, we studied FETs of two highly similar polymers PTB7 and PTB7Th. The difference in mobility was too large given the highly similar molecules and thinfilms. We showed that the difference was due to lower reorganisation energy of PTB7-Th, brought about by addition of a rigid pendant group which is missing in PTB7. This opens interesting paradigms about designing polymers to improve device performance </p>
