        <p class="description"> Self assembled monolayer (SAM) of polar materials are known to lead to reduce contact resistance in organic transistors. SAM are known to improve device characteristics and reduce contact resistance in transistors. It is generaly considered that dipole of the SAM, or its role in improving morphology of the organic semiconductor leads to low contact resistance.
We sought to decrease contact resistance of Cu electrodes in pentacene transistors, by applying SAM of two common fluorinated molecules, PFBT and PFDT, on Cu thinfilms. The differences in effect of either SAM were revealed in DFT simulations of the interface, where the orbital delocalization was found to be affected by molecular structure. This lead to uncovering of the mechanism whereby the SAM alters energy level alignemnt during interface formation, and in process dopes the semiconductor with high charge carrier concentration. We developed a model based on this mechanism to predict interface properties and device characteristics. <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.202101377">Read More</a> </p>
