<h2>Charge Carrier Doping as Mechanism of Self Assembled Monolayers in OFETs</h2>
<p> Self assembled monolayer (SAM) of polar materials are known to lead to reduce contact resistance in organic transistors. SAM are known to improve device characteristics and reduce contact resistance in transistors. It is generaly considered that dipole of the SAM, or its role in improving morphology of the organic semiconductor leads to low contact resistance.
We sought to decrease contact resistance of Cu electrodes in pentacene transistors, by applying SAM of two common fluorinated molecules, PFBT and PFDT, on Cu thinfilms. The differences in effect of either SAM were revealed in DFT simulations of the interface, where the orbital delocalization was found to be affected by molecular structure. This lead to uncovering of the mechanism whereby the SAM alters energy level alignemnt during interface formation, and in process dopes the semiconductor with high charge carrier concentration. We developed a model based on this mechanism to predict interface properties and device characteristics. <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.202101377">Read More</a> </p>

<h2>Influence of Reorganization Energy on Charge Carrier Mobility</h2>
<p> Two highly similar polymers, known as PTB7 and PTB7-Th have been successful donor materials in Organic photovoltaics, with identical molecules except the pendant group in PTB7Th is a thiophene group replacing oxygen atom in PTB7. But PTB7Th has led to a higher efficiency as compared to PTB7 devices, even if the molecular structures, as well as thinfilm properties are similar.  OFET characteristics showed that the mobility of PTB7Th is an order of magnitude higher than PTB7. The explaination for this difference can be found by taking a close look at the charge transport at molecular level. Every time a neutral polymer segment acquires a charge carrier, it undergoes a physical rearrangement, changing bond lengths and bond angles. DFT calculations on the monomer showed that the reorganization energy of PTB7Th is close to half of that of PTB7. This is because the addition of a rigid thiophene substituent group hinders the rearrangement oof chain, and the energy reuired is lower.  Hence, a charge carrier transporting accross a thinfilm of PTB7Th will face a lower energy barrier while transferring from segment to segment. Lowering energy barrier by half leads to an increase in rate of charge transfer by ten times. This is reflected in the order of magnitude difference in mobility. Thus, addition of a substituent group that imparts rigidity to the monomer and hence decreases its reorganization energy substantially may to an increase in mobility by several times. <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805878">Read More</a> </p>
