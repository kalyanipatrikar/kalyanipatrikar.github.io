<h1>PhD Research </h1>
<p> My research involves working with molecular hydrocarbon and polymer semiconductors for electronic and optoelectronic devices. The focus of my thesis has been studying features of charge transport in organic materials and at interfaces of organic devices by combining experimental and computational studies with device modeling. The results of these studies have brought about paradigm shifts in the developement of organic semiconductors, and suggested ways to tune device characteristics and enhance device performance. </p>

<h2>Charge Carrier Doping as Mechanism of Self Assembled Monolayers in OFETs</h2>
<p align="justify"> Self assembled monolayer (SAM) of polar materials are known to lead to reduce contact resistance in organic transistors. SAM are known to improve device characteristics and reduce contact resistance in transistors. It is generaly considered that dipole of the SAM, or its role in improving morphology of the organic semiconductor leads to low contact resistance.
We sought to decrease contact resistance of Cu electrodes in pentacene transistors, by applying SAM of two common fluorinated molecules, PFBT and PFDT, on Cu thinfilms. The differences in effect of either SAM were revealed in DFT simulations of the interface, where the orbital delocalization was found to be affected by molecular structure. This lead to uncovering of the mechanism whereby the SAM alters energy level alignemnt during interface formation, and in process dopes the semiconductor with high charge carrier concentration. We developed a model based on this mechanism to predict interface properties and device characteristics. <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.202101377">Read More</a> </p>

<h2>Influence of Reorganization Energy on Charge Carrier Mobility</h2>
<p> Two highly similar polymers, known as PTB7 and PTB7-Th have been successful donor materials in Organic photovoltaics, with identical molecules except the pendant group in PTB7Th is a thiophene group replacing oxygen atom in PTB7. But PTB7Th has led to a higher efficiency as compared to PTB7 devices, even if the molecular structures, as well as thinfilm properties are similar.  OFET characteristics showed that the mobility of PTB7Th is an order of magnitude higher than PTB7. The explaination for this difference can be found by taking a close look at the charge transport at molecular level. Every time a neutral polymer segment acquires a charge carrier, it undergoes a physical rearrangement, changing bond lengths and bond angles. DFT calculations on the monomer showed that the reorganization energy of PTB7Th is close to half of that of PTB7. This is because the addition of a rigid thiophene substituent group hinders the rearrangement oof chain, and the energy reuired is lower.  Hence, a charge carrier transporting accross a thinfilm of PTB7Th will face a lower energy barrier while transferring from segment to segment. Lowering energy barrier by half leads to an increase in rate of charge transfer by ten times. This is reflected in the order of magnitude difference in mobility. Thus, addition of a substituent group that imparts rigidity to the monomer and hence decreases its reorganization energy substantially may to an increase in mobility by several times. <a href="RE_OFET paper.pdf">Read More</a> </p>

	<h2>Influence of Molecular and Thinfilm Parameters on Charge Transport </h2>
	<p> Amorphous polymers with different molecular structures show differences in charge transport, but what parameters are actually making the difference? And while polymers are amorphous thinfilms, the disorder varies to affect charge transport further. We start with two polymers with different types of molecules; P3HT a homopolymer, and PTB7 a DA copolymer. We fabricated and studied device characteristics of transistors with these semiconducting polymers at different temperatures. We then carried out numerical simulations of charge transport in network of disordered sites. The values of molecular and film paramteres used in simulations gave us insight into differences in charge transport in these different polymers.</p>

	<h2> Mechanical Properties of HWCVD aSi:C Thinfilms </h2>
	<p> Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) composite thinfilms are suitable for MEMS applications. Hot Wire Chemical Vapour Deposition (HWCVD) allows deposition of SiC films from acetylene and silane precursors at high rates and with low substrate temperature. However, are the mechanical properties of HWCVD aSiC films up to the mark? We measured the Youngs Modulus of aSi:C thinfilms deposited on Si substrates by nanoindentation. Thinfilms were deposited at varying acetylene to silane flow ratio in the HWCVD chamber to vary the composition of thinfilm deposited. The nanoindentation measurements were modelled by two different methods, based on analytical models developed by Saha-Nix (SN), and Zhou-Porock (ZP), to obtain Youngs modulus independent of film thickness. The analysis compared these methods and showed that ZP method led to values constant over a larger range of thickness. The final values showed a decrease in Young's modulus by 20 GPa for thinfilms deposited with increase in acetylene:silane ratio by four times. The decrease was attributed to the increased sp3 carbon clusters within the thinfilms formed with higher carbon content, as exhibited by Raman spectra signature. </p>

		<h2> Growth of Si nanocrystals over Hafnium Dioxide thinfilms </h2>
	<p> Scaling of flash memories require the use of high-k dielectric such as hafnium dioxide to replace the more common dielectric silicon dioxide. The interface of Si with dielectric is crucial to device performance. We fabricated Si nanocrystals on hafnium oxide thinfilms, the configuraton required for flash memories. 30 nm hafnium oxide films were deposited on Si substrates by sputtering. Following this, Si films were deposited by HWCVD on the stack. Deposition was carried out in two batches, at high silane concentration and low substrate temperture to obtain amorphous silicon, and high substrate temperature and diluted silane to obtain polycrystalline silicon. All films were annealed at 850 C for 45 minutes. The annealing created stress in the CVD Si films and led to formation of cubic nancrystals sized 100 nm. We found that the polysilicon film formed larger sized crystals than the amorphous films. </p>
